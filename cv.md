3. I was interested in programming from when I was 16. Lack of available information was the main hurdle for me to learn at that time. When I was 22, I met my friend who showed me that programming was easier than I thought. That day I started programming and didn't stop doing it. I was interested in Web-Development and wanted to know how to make sites and to make people see, send and receive information. I didn't know where to start so I just searched information about programming, whatever I could find on internet. I started with HTML, continued with CSS and now I'm learning JS. My goal is to become the best version of myself and I'm willing to learn everyday. I like learning and it is very rewarding for me to learn new things I'm interested in. Web-development could not be my end-goal but as long as I'm interested, I will check for other paths and find the thing I like most.
